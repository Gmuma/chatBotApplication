**Chatbot Project using Python Backend and Dialogflow**

Welcome to our Chatbot project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for a chatbot built using Python for the backend logic and Dialogflow for natural language understanding and conversation management.

**Overview**

This project aims to create a conversational interface using a combination of Python and Dialogflow. The Python backend handles the business logic and interaction with external systems, while Dialogflow processes user inputs, understands user intent, and manages the conversation flow.

**Features**

Python Backend: 
The Python backend is responsible for:
Handling user requests received from Dialogflow.
Implementing business logic and processing user inputs.
Interacting with external APIs or databases if required.

**Dialogflow Integration:**

Dialogflow is used for:
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Understanding user intents, entities, and context.
Conversation Management: Managing the flow of conversation and responses.

**Customization:** 

This project provides a framework for customizing and extending the chatbot's functionality according to specific requirements.

**Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
Python (version >= 3.6)
Dialogflow SDK or API credentials.

**Acknowledgements**
